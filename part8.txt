mv command

mv file.txt newdir/newfile.txt
command above will cut file.txt and paste it into newfile.txt inside newdir directory
mv file.txt newdir : it will use the original file name for file movement

renaming :
there is another command named rename but it's unreliable, don't use it.
use the mv command instead :
mv file.txt new_file.txt
mv dir new_dir

some options :
-f : force overwrite on other files
-n : ban overwrite
-i : asks for overwrite
-v : gives you hint about the action
